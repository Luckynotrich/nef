            <h3>UPCOMING EVENT! 01.20.24, 10am-12pm </h3>
            <h2>F____ the Clouds: Demonstration of Distributed Solar at the Coast During Winter.</h2>
            <p>Steve Bodayla, a mobile solar power innovator, will lead a discussion and demonstration of solar’s
                viability, at the Oregon Coast, even during the dark days of winter. In an “against all odds”
                scenario, Steve will demonstrate solar’s use in 6 home based applications. And he’ll present on
                topics
                including the volume of solar and batteries needed, battery options and their respective pros and cons,
                new emerging technologies and the cost/benefits of using solar. For this free informative and inspiring
                event, click here to RSVP. (Space is limited)

            <h2>Eclipser Mixer Fundraiser and Harvest Celebration - Newledo Style</h2>
            <p>We gathered under the stars or actually under the eve of the barn in our newly created event space, the
                “Breezeway”, to indulge in foraged and farmed mocktails and appetizers. Thistle Me This and In the
                Weeds, crafted concoctions by our brilliant guest mixologists, Chloe and Walter, wowed the crowds, while
                they nibbled on broadleaf dock seed flour wraps and tarts. The walls were decorated with educational
                posters on each of the locally foraged plants, helping to spread the message of the myriad of benefits
                to be discovered in sometimes the most disparaged amongst us, common weeds. 100% of the proceeds from
                this event will go towards upgrading the electrical system in the dairy barn, so we can start hosting
                makers and events in this space</p>

            <h2>Newledo Earth Day Event - For the Love of Mushrooms </h2>
            <p>In collaboration with the Lincoln County Mycological Society
            Attendees joined in this free hands-on mushroom workshop for innoculating Alder logs with Shiitake mushroom
            spawn, learning how to drill the logs, pack the spawn, and seal the holes. Randi Stevens of Twisted
            Tidewater and Tidewater Creations led a mushroom dye demonstration. All were invited to take home inoculated
            logs for hopeful fruiting in the following winter or spring. Click here to learn more about the Lincoln

            <h2>Newledo Presents Inventor Spotlight - David Stone Community Talk and Workshop</h2>
            <p>David Stone, a material scientist from Arizona, traveled to Newledo to share about his amazing
                innovation,
                Ferrock, a carbon negative alternative to concrete. During an evening lecture and hands-on workshop
                David
                relayed the ingredients and testing he’s conducted for making this extremely durable material. One batch
                was
                made using only locally sourced ingredients including oyster shells and steel dust from brake
                refinishing.
                Workshop participants had the opportunity to view the process on how to make Ferrock and experiment with
                working with the material. To learn more about David Stone and Ferrock click here for PDF on Ferrock
                rbon and Ferrock absorbs
                carbon to harden making it one potential solution to the climate problem. </p>
