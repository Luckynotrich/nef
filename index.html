    <p class="pastures"><span class="acerage">
        Newledo is an 18 acre farm on the Oregon Coast,</span>
      situated between the Pacific Ocean and the Coast Range.
      The farm is located in a valley that was formerly a mixture of meandering
      creek and flood plain, patches of conifer trees and wide open meadows.
      Salmon and beavers abound in the creek that came to be named Beaver Creek.
      <br><br>
      The land comprising Newledo is located within the traditional homelands of the Yaqo’n, Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla
      Walla people who lived in the region for thousands of years and were forcibly removed in the 1800s.
      <br><br>
      In the late 1880s, there were fruit orchards throughout the valley, hence the name Fruitvale Road, on which the
      farm is located.
      <br><br>
      Since the early 1900s, the site was part of a larger scale dairy operation. In the 1960s-1990s, it was the
      Edenfeld Dairy, operating with 100+ dairy cows.
      <br><br>
      The current site has wide open pastures, two creeks, a pond and wetland areas and a 6000 SF barn.
      <br><br>
      In Summer 2025, the north 10-acre pasture will undergo a sizable restoration project to return Beaver Creek from
      its current trench to a meandering waterway, once again providing habitat for salmon and beaver.
