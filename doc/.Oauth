I am a self-learning student leveling up to a tech career. I am working with NodeJS, ReactJS, Postgresql and  webpack as well as HTML and CSS.

I have a 3-page JavaScript app that has two data generating pages working and a partial backend to support them. I would like to finish the backend so when I start on the data display page all the end points are complete. 

I need help creating an effective and efficient postgresql/js api
