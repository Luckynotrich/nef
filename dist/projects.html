            <h4>Biochar Project</h4>
            <p>Biochar is a stable solid, rich in carbon that is made from organic waste material or biomass that is
                partially combusted in the presence of limited oxygen. It's beneficial for building soil, creating
                housing
                for beneficial soil microbes and controlling moisture. A common attribute among all types of biochar is
                the
                primary ingredient: a recalcitrant carbon that can persist in soils for years or decades, and even
                millennia.
                <br><br>
                Wood chips are plentiful here at the Coast, so Newledo has been experimenting with using them as
                feedstock.
                Chipping downed trees and branches and using them to make biochar could also be an environmentally
                friendly
                alternative to burn piles, a common practice to get rid of such material onsite.
                <br><br>
                We’ve also been experimenting with a simple diy kiln design for making the biochar.
                <br><br>
                Once the burn ban is lifted, Newledo will be running additional experiments and possibly formal
                workshops
                led by biochar experts.
                Reach out if you’d like to learn more about our biochar project.

            <h4>Bee Project</h4>
            <p>Newledo is hosting the Bee Project, a beekeeping apprenticeship led by a long time beekeeper from the
                area. As lovers of honey, Newledo was keen to provide space for this immersive learning opportunity.
                But, we’ve also increased our flowering plants to provide sufficient food to native pollinators we were
                concerned they would be impacted by the introduction of thousands of honey bees. Newledo is surrounded
                by hundreds of blackberry bushes, so at least, in the spring and summer, there should be ample food
                supply for all.
                <br><br>
                Reach out if you’d like to learn more about the project or beekeeping.

            <h4>FLUXSCAPE Art Show </h4>
            <p>Newledo Exploration Hub, in collaboration with Rural Alchemy Workshop (R.A.W.), is launching Fluxscape, a
                year-long show that investigates shifting flows of time and land through Newledo’s 10-acre northern
                pasture,
                known as <br>The "North-10".
                <br><br>
                The “North 10 pasture” is in an interim state of transformation, with a plan for major environmental
                restoration of the site and its coastal watershed to be led by a state agency beginning in the summer of
                2025. In the meantime, a group of regional and international artists are engaging in a year-long series
                of
                durational creative experiments, installations, and public events that converse with the former
                pasture’s
                past, present, and possible future roles within surrounding coastal forest ecosystems and agricultural
                and
                industrial flows.
                <br><br>
                The site is a physical manifestation of our conflicted landscapes and state of uncertainty due to
                climate
                change, environmental degradation and human impact. The land provided grazing pastures for hundreds of
                dairy
                cows over the past 120 years. It has a mix of native and invasive plants, some in both categories useful
                to
                humans. It has Beaver Creek, which formerly meandered through the flat land but was trenched years ago
                to
                make more room for dairy cattle to graze. The creek is connected to the ocean and has some salmon but in
                its
                current state it neither provides ideal salmon or beaver habitat. It has a constructed pond home to
                various
                migrating bird flocks. It's a major flood plain in the winter, with a portion on the national wetland
                registry. The field wraps around a hillside of a neighboring tree farm clear cut in 2018.
                <br><br>
                Stay tuned for upcoming public participation and open house opportunities over the coming months. Or
