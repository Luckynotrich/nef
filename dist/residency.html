        Artists, Designers, Writers, Dancers, Musicians, Performers and Playwrights</h5>
      <h5>
        Newledo offers a residency opportunity for creative practitioners to conceptualize, develop or create work that
        responds to the site or broader bioregion, addresses the climate crisis, engages the public in regenerative
        principles or advances awareness for greater resiliency and climate conscious living.

        <h5>
          Newledo is located on a former 100 year old 18-acre dairy farm. Wide open pastures, surrounding forests and
          nearby dynamic Oregon coastline and Yaquina Bay provide rich inspiration. A resident elk herd passes through
          the
          site on frequent occasions. Various migratory birds stop by the pastures and ponds, providing great bird
          watching opportunities. And the property borders a swath of forest wonderland with trails carved out by the
          elk.

        Resident artists are invited to immerse themself in the site, set-up temporary observation stations and install
        early stage or developed works across the farm including the farmhouse, 2 ponds, 2 creeks and pastures.
        <br /><br />
        Fabrication and studio space is available in the rustic barn or covered carport.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, residents are welcome to host events, workshops or presentations to promote one’s work.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are open to practitioners at all stages of one’s career.

            We offer one residency at a time but have ongoing projects and occasional events happening, managed by
            Newledo
            or others who reside in the area. We are artists and industrial designers and love connecting with other
            practitioners. So there is opportunity to engage with other creative folks, join in the events and
            activities,
            join us in a shared meal or have full privacy and quiet time, if preferred.

                <h5>
                  All residencies include a private furnished room with a shared or private bathroom. Alternate housing
                  such as
                  tiny house parking or camping is also welcome. Included is use of all shared common areas in the main
                  5-bedroom
                  house, access to the 18 acres and barn, wifi, laundry and utilities. We have Starlink so wifi calling
                  access is
                  available for most carriers.
                  <br /><br />
                  Food/beverage is not included but we have a spacious kitchen available for use. And Newport, just
                  minutes away,
                  has a locally owned food coop, freshly caught fish for sale at the dock, a weekly farmers market,
                  latino and
                  vietnamese grocery stores and big name grocery stores. Plus you can buy fresh eggs from the 7-year old
                  neighbor
                  who sells them from his mailbox. And there are countless good dining options in the area.
                  <br /><br />
                  Temporary storage space can be provided for tools and materials, either in our shed or in the barn.
                  Storage for
                  personal items can be provided in the main house, depending on how much room is needed.

                <h5 class="header">The Location
                  <h5 />
                  <h5>
                    We’re located 3 miles from Newport, along Highway 20. Its not very safe to bike Hwy 20 nor is there
                    any public
                    transportation between us and town, so personal transportation is necessary.

                    <br /><br />
                    Newport is a vibrant fishing and tourist town of 10,000+, and has all the basic amenities, including
                    grocery
                    stores, hardware stores, banks, ATMs and gas stations. Oregon State University hosts Haftield, a
                    marine science
                    research center, offering free lectures and connection to resident and visiting scientists. NOAA
                    docks its
                    research vessels in the bay. Rogue Brewery is headquartered here. Nearby are other coastal
                    communities, such as
                    Yachats, each offering their own unique character to the Central Oregon Coast.
                    <br /><br />
                    The closest airports are Eugene (1.5 hrs away) and Portland (2.5 hrs away). There is a shuttle
                    option from
                    Portland airport to the coast. But once arriving to the area, personal transportation would be
                    necessary to get
                    between Newport and our farm.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Central Oregon Coast offers an abundance of stunning sites to see and experience, from hiking,
                    beach biking
                    and kayaking to crabbing, kiteboarding, fishing, surfing, whale watching and more. With a
                    combination of rugged
                    rocky coastline and wide-open, sparsely populated beaches, there is much to enjoy. Surrounding
                    forested
                    hillsides provide great hiking and mountain biking trails. Foraging abounds from mushrooms to
                    mussels and
                    seaweed to the many edible plants in the region.

                    <h5 class="header">What to Bring</h5>
                    <h5>
                      One should expect to bring any materials and equipment needed. There are some building supplies
                      and hardware
                      stores in the area but it's limited. And there are no art supply stores out here.
                      <br /><br />
                      The pastures and surrounding trails are quite muddy during the winter and spring so good hiking
                      boots or muck
                      boots are recommended. The temperatures tend to fluctuate throughout the day, even during the
                      summer, so layered
                      clothes seem to work best. Rain attire is highly recommended for fall through spring visits.
                      <br /><br />
                      Basics such as toiletries, insect repellent, sunscreen are typically available in Newport.
                      Fortunately, we have
                      no ticks and few mosquitos in the region.
                      <br /><br />
                      There is some great biking riding in the region and we offer storage space for bikes, when not in
                      use.
                      <br /><br />
                      There are rental shops in Newport, for heavy equipment, and outdoor equipment such as kayaks, surf
                      gear, bikes
                      and more. We also have ample room to store watercraft such kayaks or surfboards, during one’s
                      stay.

                    <h5>
                      Participants are welcome to schedule their arrival/departure as needed.
                      <br /><br />
                      The Central Oregon Coast does experience 4 seasons, with ample rainfall November through April.
                      During January
                      and February we can get light snow and/or freezing rain on occasion.
                      <br /><br />
                      June through early October tends to be perfect with 75F degrees most days, a refreshing breeze and
                      blue skies.
                      Bonus, if it does get warmer, we have both the coast, rivers and a bucolic lake nearby.

                    <h5>
                      Residencies are available for the week, month or year, depending on the need, and are offered on
                      a
                      sliding-scale. For reference, average rates are between $200-$400 for the week. (We offer a
                      discount for longer
                      stays). We strive to keep the rate well below typical accommodation costs to stay at the coast.
                      All proceeds,
                      from the residencies, do go towards supporting regenerative projects at Newledo.

                    <h5 class="header">Logistics/Policies</h5>
                    <h5>
                      Logistical issues such as transportation and securing VISAs for international artists would be
                      the
                      responsibility of the participant.
                      <br /><br />
                      Couples and Visitors Policy: Practioners are welcome to bring their partners and have
                      visitors, if staying in
                      the downstairs master bedroom or in their own accommodations (trailer or tent).
                      <br /><br />
                      Pets/Service Animals Policy: Practioners are welcome to bring pets if they come with their own
                      accommodations
                      (trailer or tent) and would be expected to be responsible for their pet during their stay. We
                      don’t have fenced
                      areas and there are coyotes and mountain lions in the vicinity.
                      <br /><br />
                      There are rental shops in Newport, for heavy equipment, and outdoor equipment such as kayaks,
                      surf gear, bikes
                      and more. We also have ample room to store watercraft such kayaks or surfboards, during one’s
                      stay.
                      <br /><br />
                      Insurance/Coverage Policy: We are a very small outfit and so cannot provide insurance coverage
                      to participants’
                      belongings, including works of art, materials and tools. All items would be the responsibility
                      of the
                      participant and, unless agreed upon with us, would be expected to be removed from the property
                      at the conclusion
                      of one’s residency.
                      <br /><br />
                      Maintenance and Upkeep Responsibility: During one’s stay, one would be expected to respect all
                      common areas, and
                      ensure all personal areas (room and designated studio/ workspace/ installation space) is
                      returned to its
                      original condition.
                      <br /><br />
                      Noise Policy: We tend to have quiet hours during the week between 10pm and 6am. We’re flexible
                      on the weekends.
                      <br /><br />
                      Additionals: We’re anti-gun so no firearms allowed. We’re flexible on moderate alcohol and
                      mild drugs
                      consumption. Smoking is not welcomed in the main house.
                      <br /><br />
                      Fire Policy: We’re sensitive to wildfire vulnerabilities. Open flame, use of candles, bbqs and
                      campfires are
                      dependent on the season. These practices should be confirmed with us beforehand.
                      <br /><br />
                      Cancellation Policy or Early Departure: Payment for residency is to be provided prior to one’s
                      stay. Refunds are
                      only available for cancellations made 2 weeks prior to one’s stay or in the case of emergency.
                      <br />

                    <h5>
                      Practitioners would need to submit the overall concept of one or more projects to be worked
                      on during one’s
                      stay, work samples (photos, audio, slides, video, text, sample pages, etc), preferred time
                      and duration of stay
                      and potential needs during one’s residency.
                      <br /><br />
                      Newledo is particularly excited to provide opportunity to practitioners working under the
                      broader umbrella of
                      sustainability/regenerative, experimenting with new projects outside of their typical
                      comfort zone or venturing
                      into new media they haven’t explored previously. With 18+ acres to work in, we invite site
                      specific, large scale
                      and earthwork based projects.
                      <br /><br />
                      Any projects that would result in changes to the property (i.e., relocating earth, cutting
                      or removing plants,
                      etc.) would need to be reviewed.
                      <br /><br />
                      Ownership of all brought or artwork created onsite will be retained by the practitioner.
