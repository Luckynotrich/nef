    <h3>Newledo Residency Opportunity</h3><br>
    <h4 class="dark">For Regenerative Focused Makers, Innovators, Designers and Artists</h4>
    <p>Newledo offers a residency opportunity for innovators and creative practitioners to conceptualize, develop or build out work that responds to the site or broader bioregion, addresses the climate crisis, engages the public in regenerative principles or advances solutions for greater resiliency and climate conscious living. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Our vision is to bring together practitioners in seemingly disparate fields, in the belief that unique synergy and innovation can come from cross pollination. </p>
    <br>
            <p>Newledo’s secondary mission is to invite in the public for immersive learning and first hand experience with these regenerative designs and practice. This provides an opportunity for Newledo residents to get exposure, feedback and interest on the part of the public and/or investors and supporters.</p>
