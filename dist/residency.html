      <h5>
        Newledo offers short and long term residency opportunities for innovators and creative
        practitioners to conceptualize, develop or build out work that responds
        to the 18-acre farm or the broader bioregion, addresses the climate crisis, engages the public in
        regenerative principles or advances solutions for greater resiliency and climate conscious living.
        <br /><br />
        Our vision is to bring together practitioners in seemingly disparate fields,
        in the belief that unique synergy and innovation can come from cross pollination.
        <br />
        <br />
        Newledo’s secondary mission is to invite in the public for immersive learning and first hand experience with
        these regenerative designs and practice. This provides an opportunity for residents to get exposure, feedback
        and interest on the part of the public and/or
        investors and supporters. They would also be invited to host a demonstration of an early
        stage prototype or refined solution or install such works for short or long term evaluation. <br />

        Residency includes furnished housing, wifi, use of all shared common areas
        in the main house, access to
        a studio space in the barn, use of the wood shop or other areas for fabrication.
